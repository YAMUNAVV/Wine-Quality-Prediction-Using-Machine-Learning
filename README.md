For this project, I used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:

## Description of Dataset

* volatile acidity : Volatile acidity is the gaseous acids present in wine.
* fixed acidity : Primary fixed acids found in wine are tartaric, succinic, citric, and malic
* residual sugar : Amount of sugar left after fermentation.
* citric acid : It is weak organic acid, found in citrus fruits naturally.
* chlorides : Amount of salt present in wine.
* free sulfur dioxide : So2 is used for prevention of wine by oxidation and microbial spoilage.
* total sulfur dioxide
* pH : In wine pH is used for checking acidity
* density
* sulphates : Added sulfites preserve freshness and protect wine from oxidation, and bacteria.
* alcohol : Percent of alcohol present in wine

According to experts, the wine is differentiated according to its smell, flavor, and color, but we are not a wine expert to say that wine is good or bad. What will we do then? Here’s the use of Machine Learning comes, yes you are thinking to write we are using machine learning to check wine quality. ML have some techniques that will discuss below:
